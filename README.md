# S4 (WIP)

S4 stands for the Standardized Supercollider Synthdef System.

This goal of this system is to write complex sound or midi generators in supercollider in a way that they can

- Allow for presets to quickly be demoed
- Allow meta data about author, inspiration, timbre, and possible uses to be read by consumers
- Allow Easy integration in larger systems

## Get involved!

If you want to get involved, please do! We are looking for contributions of all kinds :-)

If you want to meet IRL come by an event of [Berlin Supercollider Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Supercollider-Hack-Learn-and-Play/)

## General Idea

If Ugens are the cells of a SC composition, Synthdefs are the organs.
Despite there being a consistent syntax for Ugens, Synthdefs allow for many different ways to be built.
Although this creates great freedom of expression, it also creates a learning curve when encountering a new synthdef.

From a personal artistic viewpoint, I have written several synthdefs that I come back to and think "wtf was I doing with this?"
I am getting too old to be constantly re-writing synthdefs and would like to start a shared library of my instruments for myself and others to use
But first, I need to figure out how to create a synthdef in a way that I and others want to use!


## Tentative plan

- [ ] Find other contributors
- [ ] Establish best way to create Synthdef allowing for meta data without compromising expression
- [ ] MVP for large system exchanging two syth defs in this format and not breaking
- [ ] Gather and modify common synth pools to fit S4 in order to share within the community
- [ ] Deploy standardized synths to more reachable supercollider website
- [ ] Profit?
